# **Farewell Management System – Full Project Plan (Narrative Version)**

The Farewell Management System is a cross-platform application designed to centralize and streamline everything involved in organizing a farewell event. The system operates across web and mobile environments and relies on a robust backend architecture using Supabase for authentication, storage, database schemas, row-level security, and real-time functionalities. On the web, the platform is built using Next.js 14 with modern server components, shadcn-based interfaces, TailwindCSS styling, and optional Framer Motion enhancements. On mobile, the system is implemented using React Native through the Expo framework, ensuring seamless feature parity with the web experience.

The purpose of the system is to consolidate all farewell-related activities into a unified platform. Users can create farewell events, join events through invitation links or QR codes, contribute financially through Razorpay, receive duties from organizers, upload receipts for reimbursements, communicate through real-time chat channels, upload memories to a gallery, browse announcements, receive notifications, and review a complete history of all farewell operations. Every feature is designed to operate cohesively under a secure role- and permission-driven model.

The authentication system serves as the foundation of the project. It uses Supabase Auth for handling logins, signups, password resets, verification, session tracking, and device-level logging. The architecture stores user roles and membership information inside JWT claims to ensure extremely fast server-side access to permissions with minimal database queries. Authentication screens are built using shadcn’s form components with strict validation via Zod, and routing is strictly enforced using middleware so that protected pages such as dashboards and farewell-detail routes cannot be accessed without a valid session. The system supports both email/password and OAuth (Google or GitHub) depending on future requirements. There is also a planned device fingerprinting mechanism that stores anonymous device identifiers to track login behavior and improve security monitoring.

Once authenticated, users can create farewell events. A farewell event includes metadata such as the farewell title, date, expected budget, members involved, and configuration settings regarding contributions, duties, reimbursements, and visibility. When a farewell is created, Supabase triggers automatically assign the creator as the main admin of the farewell. Members can join via invite links, QR codes, or request-based mechanisms. Joining a farewell sets up the user’s membership row, determines their role, and instantly updates JWT claims to reflect their updated permissions. A user who joins multiple farewells will see their Home Dashboard aggregated with shortcuts to all farewell spaces.

The contribution management subsystem enables organizers to collect money transparently. Organizers can create contribution pools for specific items or global farewell funds. Razorpay integration powers the actual payment layer. The user initiates a payment from the web or mobile interface, the Razorpay checkout window processes it, and after payment, a Supabase Edge Function verifies the payment signature. This verification ensures there is no compromised or tampered transaction. Once verified, a contribution entry is stored inside the database, the farewell balance updates automatically, and real-time events notify all members that new contributions have been added. Users can see who contributed, how much remains to be collected, and the spending summary linked to the reimbursement system.

The duty assignment system structures the operational work of organizing a farewell. Organizers can create duties such as “Decoration”, “Food Arrangements”, “Transport Coordination”, or any custom responsibility. Duties can be assigned to one or more volunteers. Volunteers can update their progress status as “Pending”, “In Progress”, or “Done”. If expenses are incurred, volunteers upload receipts using the mobile or web interface. Every receipt is logged, stored in Supabase Storage, and linked to the duty. Administrators can then review each receipt, approve or reject the reimbursement, and track the financial status of each duty in detail. The system maintains an audit trail so that every change is recorded, which simplifies post-event analysis and protects against misuse.

The reimbursement workflow ties into the transparent financial system of the event. A volunteer who uploads a receipt creates a reimbursement request awaiting admin approval. The admin examines the uploaded evidence, verifies the amounts, and approves or rejects the claim. The system updates balances, and users can export reimbursement data for accounting or personal reference. Each reimbursement action is logged into the audit log for future reference or compliance.

Communication happens through the real-time chat system built on Supabase Realtime. Each farewell contains multiple chat channels, including a general group channel and optionally additional topic-specific channels. Users see live typing indicators, online presence indicators, message timestamps, and media attachments. The chat experience mirrors modern messaging platforms but remains tightly integrated within the farewell workspace. Direct message channels between individual users may also be enabled. Mentions help notify users about specific messages, and all chat data is stored in a secure and permission-controlled manner.

Announcements serve as a broadcast space inside a farewell. Organizers can publish updates such as meeting times, task reminders, or important deadlines. Announcements appear in chronological order, and users receive notifications through push notifications on mobile and optionally browser notifications on the web. These announcements help maintain clarity and reduce reliance on external messaging apps for event updates.

The gallery system acts as a memorial archive for the farewell. Members upload photos and videos from the event or preparation stages. Supabase Storage hosts the media, and the system auto-generates thumbnails for fast loading. Albums are organized by farewell, and members can browse or download items. Highlights may be generated later as a value-added feature.

The member management system defines the roles: main admin, regular admin, finance admin, member, and guest. Each role has defined permissions like editing farewell details, approving reimbursements, managing contributions, posting announcements, managing chat channels, or uploading gallery items. These permissions are enforced through Supabase Row Level Security policies, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.

The joining flow determines how users enter a farewell. When a user clicks an invite link or scans a QR code, they are guided through the authentication system and then automatically added to the farewell with the appropriate role. If the farewell is configured for approval-based joining, the user is added to a pending list, and admins must approve them manually.

The farewell dashboard shows users everything at a glance: contributions, duties, announcements, gallery highlights, chat previews, and member lists. It acts as the command center of the farewell with shortcuts to individual modules. Every user sees different options depending on their role.

When the mobile app progresses toward completion, an APK distribution system will be implemented using Supabase’s signed URLs. This ensures secure delivery of app binaries without exposing permanent public links. The signed URL expires automatically and can only be downloaded within a controlled timeframe. This will be integrated only when the app reaches the correct stage.

The backend is entirely driven by Supabase. Tables include users, farewells, farewell members, duties, contributions, payments, receipts, chat channels, messages, gallery items, notifications, announcements, and a complete audit log. Edge Functions handle sensitive operations like payment verification or secure media URL generation. Storage manages all file assets including gallery images, receipts, and the eventual APK.

The development roadmap begins with foundational database work, RLS rules, and RPC functions. Then the landing page is built. Following that, the authentication system is implemented in full. After authentication, the farewell core is built, followed by contributions and Razorpay integration. Duties and reimbursements come next, then chat, gallery, notifications, mobile app screens, and finally production hardening and optimization features.

When the project is complete, the system will provide a seamless, professional-grade farewell management environment that operates securely across all platforms, supports financial transactions, handles communications, organizes tasks, and maintains a shared memory space. It becomes the central platform for planned collaboration and celebration, providing transparency, efficiency, and modern user experience in organizing farewell events.
